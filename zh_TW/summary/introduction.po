"In software development, we often come across problems that share "
"similarities regardless of the environment they appear in. Although the "
"implementation details are crucial to solve the task at hand, we may "
"abstract from these particularities to find the common practices that are "
"generically applicable."

"Design patterns are a collection of reusable and tested solutions to "
"recurring problems in engineering. They make our software more modular, "
"maintainable, and extensible. Moreover, these patterns provide a common "
"language for developers, making them an excellent tool for effective "
"communication when problem-solving in teams."

"Keep in mind: Each pattern comes with its own set of trade-offs. It's "
"crucial to focus on why you choose a particular pattern rather than just on "
"how to implement it.[^1]"

"Rust is not object-oriented, and the combination of all its characteristics, "
"such as functional elements, a strong type system, and the borrow checker, "
"makes it unique. Because of this, Rust design patterns vary with respect to "
"other traditional object-oriented programming languages. That's why we "
"decided to write this book. We hope you enjoy reading it! The book is "
"divided in three main chapters:"
