"In computer science, _functional programming_ is a programming paradigm "
"where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a "
"declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of "
"expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative "
"statements which change the state of the program."
