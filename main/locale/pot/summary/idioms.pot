"After all, the computer only cares about the machine code that is generated "
"by the compiler. Instead, the source code is mainly beneficial to the "

"are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should "
"be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided\"."
