msgid "Discussion"
msgstr ""

#: src/patterns/creational/builder.md:86
msgid ""
"This pattern is seen more frequently in Rust (and for simpler objects) than "
"in many other languages because Rust lacks overloading and default values "
"for function parameters. Since you can only have a single method with a "
"given name, having multiple constructors is less nice in Rust than in C++, "
"Java, or others."
msgstr ""

#: src/patterns/creational/builder.md:91
msgid ""
"This pattern is often used where the builder object is useful in its own "
"right, rather than being just a builder. For example, see [`std::process::"
"Command`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html) is a "
"builder for [`Child`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Child."
"html) (a process). In these cases, the `T` and `TBuilder` naming pattern is "
"not used."

#: src/patterns/creational/builder.md:98
msgid ""
"The example takes and returns the builder by value. It is often more "
"ergonomic (and more efficient) to take and return the builder as a mutable "
"reference. The borrow checker makes this work naturally. This approach has "
"the advantage that one can write code like"
