msgid ""
"The [Strategy design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Strategy_pattern) is a technique that enables separation of concerns. It "
"also allows to decouple software modules through [Dependency Inversion]"
"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)."
msgstr ""

#: src/patterns/behavioural/strategy.md:10
msgid ""
"The basic idea behind the Strategy pattern is that, given an algorithm "
"solving a particular problem, we define only the skeleton of the algorithm "
"at an abstract level, and we separate the specific algorithm’s "
"implementation into different parts."
msgstr ""

#: src/patterns/behavioural/strategy.md:15
msgid ""
"In this way, a client using the algorithm may choose a specific "
"implementation, while the general algorithm workflow remains the same. In "
"other words, the abstract specification of the class does not depend on the "
"specific implementation of the derived class, but specific implementation "
"must adhere to the abstract specification. This is why we call it "
"\"Dependency Inversion\"."

msgid "Motivation"
msgstr ""

#: src/patterns/behavioural/strategy.md:23
msgid ""
"Imagine we are working on a project that generates reports every month. We "
"need the reports to be generated in different formats (strategies), e.g., in "
"`JSON` or `Plain Text` formats. But things vary over time, and we don't know "
"what kind of requirement we may get in the future. For example, we may need "
"to generate our report in a completely new format, or just modify one of the "
"existing formats."

#: src/patterns/behavioural/strategy.md:30
msgid "Example"
msgstr ""

#: src/patterns/behavioural/strategy.md:32
msgid ""
"In this example our invariants (or abstractions) are `Formatter` and "
"`Report`, while `Text` and `Json` are our strategy structs. These strategies "
"have to implement the `Formatter` trait."

#: src/patterns/behavioural/strategy.md:100
msgid ""
"The main advantage is separation of concerns. For example, in this case "
"`Report` does not know anything about specific implementations of `Json` and "
"`Text`, whereas the output implementations does not care about how data is "
"preprocessed, stored, and fetched. The only thing they have to know is a "
"specific trait to implement and its method defining the concrete algorithm "
"implementation processing the result, i.e., `Formatter` and `format(...)`."

msgid "Disadvantages"
msgstr ""

#: src/patterns/behavioural/strategy.md:109
msgid ""
"For each strategy there must be implemented at least one module, so number "
"of modules increases with number of strategies. If there are many strategies "
"to choose from then users have to know how strategies differ from one "
"another."

"Serde crate is a good example of the `Strategy` pattern in action. Serde "
"allows [full customization](https://serde.rs/custom-serialization.html) of "
"the serialization behavior by manually implementing `Serialize` and "
"`Deserialize` traits for our type. For example, we could easily swap "
"`serde_json` with `serde_cbor` since they expose similar methods. Having "
"this makes the helper crate `serde_transcode` much more useful and ergonomic."
