msgid ""
"By disallowing the compiler to build with warnings, a crate author opts out "
"of Rust's famed stability. Sometimes new features or old misfeatures need a "
"change in how things are done, thus lints are written that `warn` for a "
"certain grace period before being turned to `deny`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, it was discovered that a type could have two `impl`s with the "
"same method. This was deemed a bad idea, but in order to make the transition "
"smooth, the `overlapping-inherent-impls` lint was introduced to give a "
"warning to those stumbling on this fact, before it becomes a hard error in a "
"future release."
msgstr ""

#: src/anti_patterns/deny-warnings.md:32

"Also sometimes APIs get deprecated, so their use will emit a warning where "
"before there was none."

"All this conspires to potentially break the build whenever something changes."

"Furthermore, crates that supply additional lints (e.g. [rust-clippy](https://"
"github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)) can no longer be used unless the "
"annotation is removed. This is mitigated with [\\--cap-lints](https://doc."
"rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#capping-lints). The `--cap-lints=warn` "
"command line argument, turns all `deny` lint errors into warnings."

"There are two ways of tackling this problem: First, we can decouple the "
"build setting from the code, and second, we can name the lints we want to "
"deny explicitly."

"This can be done by any individual developer (or be set in a CI tool like "
"Travis, but remember that this may break the build when something changes) "
"without requiring a change to the code."

"Alternatively, we can specify the lints that we want to `deny` in the code. "
