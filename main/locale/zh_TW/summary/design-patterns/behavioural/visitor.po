msgid ""
"A visitor encapsulates an algorithm that operates over a heterogeneous "
"collection of objects. It allows multiple different algorithms to be written "
"over the same data without having to modify the data (or their primary "
"behaviour)."

#: src/patterns/behavioural/visitor.md:10
msgid ""
"Furthermore, the visitor pattern allows separating the traversal of a "
"collection of objects from the operations performed on each object."

msgid ""
"The visitor pattern is useful anywhere that you want to apply an algorithm "
"to heterogeneous data. If data is homogeneous, you can use an iterator-like "
"pattern. Using a visitor object (rather than a functional approach) allows "
"the visitor to be stateful and thus communicate information between nodes."

"It is common for the `visit_*` methods to return void (as opposed to in the "
"example). In that case it is possible to factor out the traversal code and "
"share it between algorithms (and also to provide noop default methods). In "
"Rust, the common way to do this is to provide `walk_*` functions for each "
"datum. For example,"

"In other languages (e.g., Java) it is common for data to have an `accept` "
