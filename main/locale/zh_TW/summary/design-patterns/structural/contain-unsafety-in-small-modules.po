"If you have `unsafe` code, create the smallest possible module that can "
"uphold the needed invariants to build a minimal safe interface upon the "
"unsafety. Embed this into a larger module that contains only safe code and "
"presents an ergonomic interface. Note that the outer module can contain "
"unsafe functions and methods that call directly into the unsafe code. Users "
"may use this to gain speed benefits."

"`std`'s `String` class is a wrapper over `Vec<u8>` with the added invariant "
"that the contents must be valid UTF-8. The operations on `String` ensure "
"this behavior. However, users have the option of using an `unsafe` method to "
"create a `String`, in which case the onus is on them to guarantee the "
"validity of the contents."
