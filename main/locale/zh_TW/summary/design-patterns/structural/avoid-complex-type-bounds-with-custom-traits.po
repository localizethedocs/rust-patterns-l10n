"Trait bounds can become somewhat unwieldy, especially if one of the `Fn` "
"traits[^fn-traits] is involved and there are specific requirements on the "
"output type. In such cases the introduction of a new trait may help reduce "
"verbosity, eliminate some type parameters and thus increase expressiveness. "
"Such a trait can be accompanied with a generic `impl` for all types "
"satisfying the original bound."

"Let's imagine some sort of monitoring or information gathering system. The "
"system retrieves values of various types from diverse sources. It may derive "
"from them some sort of status indicating issues. For example, the total "
"amount of free memory should be above a certain theshold, and the user with "
"the id `0` should always be named \"root\"."

"For management reasons, we probably want type erasure on the top level. "
"However, we also need to provide specific (user configurable) assesments for "
"specific types of data sources (e.g. thresholds and ranges for numerical "
"types). And since sources for these values are diverse, we may choose to "
"supply data sources as closures that return a value when called. Because we "
"are probably getting those values from the operating system, we are likely "
"confronted with operations that may fail."

"With these types, we will need to repeat the trait bounds for `G` in at "
"least a few places. Readability suffers, partially due the the fact that the "
"getter returns a `Result`. Introducing a bound for \"getters\" allows a more "
"expressive bound and eliminate one of the type parameters:"

"Introducing a new trait can help simplify type bounds, particularly via the "
"elimination of type parameters. A good name for the new trait will also make "
"the bound more expressive. The new trait, an abstraction, also offers "
"opportunities in itself, including:"

"Introducing new items such as the trait means we need to find an appropriate "
"name and place for it. It also means one more item users of the original "
"functionality need to investigate[^read-docs]. Depending on presentation, it "
"may not be obvious right away that a simple closure may be used as a "
"`Getter` in the example above."
