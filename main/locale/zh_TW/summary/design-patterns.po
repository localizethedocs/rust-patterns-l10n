"[Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) are "
"\"general reusable solutions to a commonly occurring problem within a given "
"context in software design\". Design patterns are a great way to describe "
"the culture of a programming language. Design patterns are very language-"
"specific - what is a pattern in one language may be unnecessary in another "
"due to a language feature, or impossible to express due to a missing feature."

"If overused, design patterns can add unnecessary complexity to programs. "
"However, they are a great way to share intermediate and advanced level "
"knowledge about a programming language."

"Rust has many unique features. These features give us great benefit by "

"If we apply YAGNI to design patterns, we see that the features of Rust allow "
"us to throw out many patterns. For instance, there is no need for the "
"[strategy pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) in Rust "
"because we can just use [traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/traits.html)."
