"An [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern) is a solution "
"to a \"recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly "
"counterproductive\". Just as valuable as knowing how to solve a problem, is "
"knowing how _not_ to solve it. Anti-patterns give us great counter-examples "
"to consider relative to design patterns. Anti-patterns are not confined to "
"code. For example, a process can be an anti-pattern, too."
